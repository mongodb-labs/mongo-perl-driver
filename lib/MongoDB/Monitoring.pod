# PODNAME: MongoDB::Monitoring
# ABSTRACT: Internal event monitoring API for instrumentation

=pod

=encoding UTF-8

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<MongoDB::MongoClient> takes an optional C<monitoring_callback>
attribute, which can be used to monitor events that occur during the
operation of the driver.

The API is very simple: given a code reference, a hashref for each event
is passed to the code reference.  Here is a simple example that just
accumulates events in an array:

    our @events;
    my $cb = sub { push @events, $_[0] };

    MongoDB->connect( $uri, { monitoring_callback => $cb } );

=head1 EVENT TYPES

Every event is a hash reference, with a C<type> field indicating the type,
e.g. C<command_started>.  Each type is described below.

=head2 command_started

This event is sent just before a command is put one the wire.  It will be
followed by either a C<command_succeeded> or C<command_failed> event.

Fields:

=for :list
* type: "command_started"
* databaseName: the name of the database to which the command applies
* commandName: the name of the command being excuted; for legacy operations
  that don't use commands, the driver will convert them to appear as if
  they are in command form.
* command: a hash reference representing the full command to be sent
* requestId: the request identifier sent to the server
* connectionId: address and port of the destination server

=head2 command_succeeded

This event is sent just after a command reply is received, but only if the
database reply document contains a non-false C<ok> field.  NOTE: write
errors will have C<ok:1> even though they have write errors; for writes,
success indicates that the write attempt was valid, not that the write
succeeded.

Fields:

=for :list
* type: "command_succeeded"
* commandName: the name of the command being excuted
* durationSecs: the elapsed time in seconds since the C<command_started>
  event.
* reply: a hash reference representing the full database reply
* requestId: the request identifier sent to the server
* connectionId: address and port of the destination server

=head2 command_failed

This event is sent just after a command reply is received, but only if the
database reply document contains a false C<ok> field or if an exception
occurred during send or receive operations.

Fields:

=for :list
* type: "command_failed"
* commandName: the name of the command being excuted
* durationSecs: the elapsed time in seconds since the C<command_started>
  event.
* failure: a string with a error message about the failure
* eval_error: if an exception occurs, this contains the value of C<$@>
  when the exception was caught
* reply: a hash reference representing the full database reply or an empty
  hashref if the failure is due to an exception
* requestId: the request identifier sent to the server
* connectionId: address and port of the destination server
