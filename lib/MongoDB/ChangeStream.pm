    $change_stream = $collection->watch(...);

Waits for the next change in the collection and returns it.

B<Note>: This method will wait for the amount of milliseconds passed
as C<maxAwaitTimeMS> to L<MongoDB::Collection/watch> or the server's
default wait-time. It will not wait indefinitely.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $stream = $collection->watch( $pipeline, $options );
    while(1) {

        # This inner loop will only iterate until there are no more
        # changes available.
        while (my $change = $stream->next) {

        }
