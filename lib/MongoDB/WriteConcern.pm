=attr w

Specifies the desired acknowledgement level. Defaults to '1'.

=cut

has w => (
    is        => 'ro',
    isa       => Maybe [Str],
    predicate => '_has_w',
);

=attr wtimeout

Specifies how long to wait for the write concern to be satisfied (in
milliseonds).  Defaults to 1000.

=cut

has wtimeout => (
    is        => 'ro',
    isa       => Num,
    predicate => '_has_wtimeout',
    default   => 1000,
);

=attr j

The j option confirms that the mongod instance has written the data to the
on-disk journal.  Defaults to false.

B<Note>: specifying a write concern that set j to a true value may result in an
error with a mongod or mongos running with --nojournal option now errors.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $rp = MongoDB::WriteConcern->new(); # w:1, wtimeout: 1000

    $rp = MongoDB::WriteConcern->new(
        w        => 'majority',
        wtimeout => 10000, # milliseconds
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A write concern describes the guarantee that MongoDB provides when reporting on
the success of a write operation.
