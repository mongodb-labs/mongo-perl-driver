=attr database

The L<MongoDB::Database> containing the GridFS bucket collections.

=cut

has database => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => InstanceOf ['MongoDB::Database'],
    required => 1,
);

=attr bucket_name

The name of the GridFS bucket.  Defaults to 'fs'.  The underlying
collections that are used to implement a GridFS bucket get this string as a
prefix (e.g "fs.chunks").

=cut

has bucket_name => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => Str,
    default => sub { 'fs' },
);

=attr chunk_size_bytes

The number of bytes per chunk.  Defaults to 261120 (255kb).

=cut

has chunk_size_bytes => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => NonNegNum,
    default => sub { 255 * 1024 },
);

=attr write_concern

A L<MongoDB::WriteConcern> object.  It may be initialized with a hash
reference that will be coerced into a new MongoDB::WriteConcern object.
By default it will be inherited from a L<MongoDB::Database> object.

=cut

has write_concern => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => WriteConcern,
    required => 1,
    coerce   => WriteConcern->coercion,
);

=attr read_concern

A L<MongoDB::ReadConcern> object.  May be initialized with a hash
reference or a string that will be coerced into the level of read
concern.

By default it will be inherited from a L<MongoDB::Database> object.

=cut

has read_concern => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => ReadConcern,
    required => 1,
    coerce   => ReadConcern->coercion,
);

=attr read_preference

A L<MongoDB::ReadPreference> object.  It may be initialized with a string
corresponding to one of the valid read preference modes or a hash reference
that will be coerced into a new MongoDB::ReadPreference object.
By default it will be inherited from a L<MongoDB::Database> object.

B<Note:> Because many GridFS operations require multiple independent reads from
separate collections, use with secondaries is B<strongly discouraged> because
reads could go to different secondaries, resulting in inconsistent data
if all file and chunk documents have not replicated to all secondaries.

=cut

has read_preference => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => ReadPreference,
    required => 1,
    coerce   => ReadPreference->coercion,
);

=attr bson_codec

An object that provides the C<encode_one> and C<decode_one> methods, such
as from L<MongoDB::BSON>.  It may be initialized with a hash reference that
will be coerced into a new MongoDB::BSON object.  By default it will be
inherited from a L<MongoDB::Database> object.

=cut

has bson_codec => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => BSONCodec,
    coerce   => BSONCodec->coercion,
    required => 1,
);

=attr max_time_ms

Specifies the maximum amount of time in milliseconds that the server should
use for working on a query.  By default it will be inherited from a
L<MongoDB::Database> object.

B<Note>: this will only be used for server versions 2.6 or greater, as that
was when the C<$maxTimeMS> meta-operator was introduced.

=cut

has max_time_ms => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => NonNegNum,
    required => 1,

Executes a query on the file documents collection with a

returns a L<MongoDB::QueryResult> object.  It takes an optional hashref
of options identical to L<MongoDB::Collection/find>.

Executes a query on the file documents collection with a
L<filter expression|MongoDB::Collection/Filter expression> and
returns the first document found, or C<undef> if no document is found.

See L<MongoDB::Collection/find_one> for details about the
C<$projection> and optional C<$options> fields.

is found.

See L<MongoDB::Collection/find_one> for details about the

    $line = $stream->readline;

Returns a new L<MongoDB::GridFSBucket::DownloadStream> that can be used to
download the file with the file document C<_id> matching C<$id>.  This
throws a L<MongoDB::GridFSError> if no such file exists.

Returns a new L<MongoDB::GridFSBucket::UploadStream> that can be used
to upload a new file to a GridFS bucket.

This method requires a filename to store in the C<filename> field of the
file document.  B<Note>: the filename is an arbitrary string; the method
does not read from this filename locally.

You can provide an optional hash reference of options that are passed to the
L<MongoDB::GridFSBucket::UploadStream> constructor:

=for :list
* C<chunk_size_bytes> – the number of bytes per chunk.  Defaults to the
  C<chunk_size_bytes> of the bucket object.
* C<metadata> – a hash reference for storing arbitrary metadata about the
  file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $bucket = $database->gfs;

    # upload a file
    $stream  = $bucket->open_upload_stream("foo.txt");
    $stream->print( $data );
    $stream->close;

    # find and download a file
    $result  = $bucket->find({filename => "foo.txt"});
    $file_id = $result->next->{_id};
    $stream  = $bucket->open_download_stream($file_id)
    $data    = do { local $/; $stream->readline() };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class models a GridFS file store in a MongoDB database and provides an
API for interacting with it.

Generally, you never construct one of these directly with C<new>.  Instead,
you call C<gfs> (short for C<get_gridfsbucket>) on a L<MongoDB::Database>
object.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 Data model

A GridFS file is represented in MongoDB as a "file document" with
information like the file's name, length, MD5 hash, and any user-supplied
metadata.  The actual contents are stored as a number of "chunks" of binary
data.  (Think of the file document as a directory entry and the chunks like
blocks on disk.)

Valid file documents typically include the following fields:

=for :list
* _id – a unique ID for this document, typically type BSON ObjectId.
* length – the length of this stored file, in bytes
* chunkSize – the size, in bytes, of each full data chunk of this file. This
  value is configurable per file.
* uploadDate – the date and time this file was added to GridFS, stored as
  a BSON datetime value.
* md5 – a hash of the contents of the stored file
* filename – the name of this stored file; this does not need to be unique
* metadata – any additional application data the user wishes to store
  (optional)
* contentType – DEPRECATED (store this in C<metadata> if you need it)
  (optional)
* aliases – DEPRECATED (store this in C<metadata> if you need it)
  (optional)

The C<find> method searches file documents using these fields.  Given the
C<_id> from a document, a file can be downloaded using the download
methods.

=head2 API Overview

In addition to general methods like C<find>, C<delete> and C<drop>, there
are two ways to go about uploading and downloading:

=for :list
* filehandle-like: you get an object that you can read/write from similar
  to a filehandle.  You can even get a tied filehandle that you can
  hand off to other code that requires an actual Perl handle.
* streaming: you provide a file handle to read from (upload) or print
  to (download) and data is streamed to (upload) or from (download)
  GridFS until EOF.

=head2 Error handling

Unless otherwise explicitly documented, all methods throw exceptions if
an error occurs.  The error types are documented in L<MongoDB::Error>.
