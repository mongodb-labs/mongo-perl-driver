# Change history for the MongoDB Perl driver:

{{ $NEXT }}

  [*** Deprecations ***]

  - The MongoDB::GridFS and MongoDB::GridFS::File classes are deprecated
    in favor of the MongoDB::GridFSBucket and related classes.  It will
    be removed in a future major release.

  [Additions]

  - Adds MongoDB::GridFSBucket class, which implements the new
    driver-standard GridFS API.  Also included are classes to emulate file
    handles for uploads and downloads, making GridFS operations more
    composable with existing Perl libraries.

v1.2.0    2015-12-07 12:55:11-05:00 America/New_York

  [Additions]

  - PERL-561 Add support for bypassDocumentValidation option to relevant
    CRUD methods.

  - PERL-564 Add support for readConcern (for MongoDB 3.2 only).

  - PERL-569 Add 'batch' method to QueryResult for retrieving a chunk of
    results instead of just one (via 'next') or all.

  - PERL-594 Add maxAwaitTimeMS option for tailable-await cursors on
    MongoDB 3.2 servers.

  - Add find_id method to MongoDB::Collection for easy retrieval of a
    single document by _id.

  - Add support for write concern find-and-modify-style methods (for
    MongoDB 3.2 only)

  [Bug fixes]

  - PERL-493 Don't send writeConcern if it is not set; this allows the user
    to get the default write concern set on the server.

  - PERL-571 Add -D_GNU_SOURCE to ccflags if needed.

  - PERL-597 Check findAndModify-type command results for
    writeConcernErrors (for MongoDB 3.2 only).

  [Changes]

  - PERL-595 Change limit/batchSize behavior to match CRUD spec; most users
    won't notice the difference, but generally speaking, when there is both
    a limit and a batch size, under MongoDB 3.2, the batch size is
    respected if it is smaller than the limit.  Previously, in some cases,
    the batch size was ignored and the limit used instead.

  [Documentation]

  - PERL-570 Update MongoDB::Cursor::info documentation.

  - Replace term 'slave' with 'secondary' in docs.

  [Testing]

  - Skip fsync test on inMemory storage engine.

  [~ Internal changes ~]

  - PERL-558 Implement fsyncUnlock as a command for MongoDB 3.2+.

  - PERL-563 Implement find/getMore/killCursors as commands for MongoDB
    3.2+.

  - Verify that server replies are less than maxMessageSizeBytes.

v1.0.2    2015-10-14 15:26:30-04:00 America/New_York

  [Bug fixes]

  - PERL-198 Validate user-constructed MongoDB::OID objects; also
    coerces to lower case for consistency with generated OIDs.

  - PERL-495 Preserve fractional seconds when using dt_type 'raw'

  - PERL-571 Include limits.h explicitly rather than relying on other
    headers to load it.

  - PERL-526 Detect stale primaries by election_id (only supported by
    MongoDB 3.0 or later)

  - PERL-575 Copy inflated booleans instead of aliasing them.

  - Fix a failing test in the case where a user is running a
    single-node replica set.

  [Documentation]

  - PERL-532 Document loss of precision when serializing long doubles

  - Noted that IPv6 support requires IO::Socket::IP (core since
    Perl v5.20.0).

  [Prerequisites]

  - PERL-579 Require at least version 0.25 of boolean.pm

  [~ Internal changes ~]

  - PERL-475 Optimize 'all' QueryResult method

v1.0.1    2015-09-22 12:55:08-04:00 America/New_York

  [Bug fixes]

  - PERL-567 Fixed a failing test in the case where a user is running a
    replica set on the default port 27017.

  [Documentation]

  - PERL-568 Fixed SYNOPSIS of MongoDB.pm

  - Clarified some confusing sections of MongoDB::Tutorial and added
    hyperlinks to documentation for methods used in the tutorial.

  - Clarified some sections of MongoDB::Collection and MongoDB::Cursor
    and added some hyperlinks.

v1.0.0    2015-09-21 16:15:04-04:00 America/New_York

  [!!! Incompatible Changes !!!]

  - The v1.0.0 driver includes numerous incompatible changes; users are
    STRONGLY encouraged to read MongoDB::Upgrading for advice on upgrading
    applications written for the 'v0' driver.

  - PERL-221 The 'inflate_regexps' MongoDB::MongoClient option has been
    removed.  BSON regular expressions always decode to
    MongoDB::BSON::Regexp objects. This ensure safety and consistency with
    other drivers.

  - PERL-330 The driver now uses pure-Perl networking; SSL and SASL now
    implemented via optional CPAN modules IO::Socket::SSL and Authen::SASL.

  - PERL-442 Connection string options have revised to match MongoClient
    options; connection string options always take precedence over
    MongoClient constructor arguments.

  - PERL-470 The MongoDB::Cursor globals "slave_ok" and "timeout" no longer
    have any effect and have been removed.

  - PERL-471 The MongoDB::Cursor 'snapshot' method now requires a boolean
    argument.

  - PERL-505 When bulk inserting a document without an '_id' field, the _id
    will be added during BSON encoding, but the original document will NOT
    be changed.  (This was the case for regular insertion in the v0.x
    series, but not for the Bulk API.)

  - PERL-519 The $MongoDB::BSON::use_binary global variable has been
    removed. Binary data always decodes to MongoDB::BSON::Binary objects
    (which now overload stringification).  This ensures that binary data
    will correctly round-trip.

  - PERL-520 The $MongoDB::BSON::utf8_flag_on global variable has been
    removed. BSON strings will always be decoded to Perl character strings.
    This ensures that string data will correctly round-trip.

  - PERL-523 Requires a replica set name explicitly to connect to a replica
    set.  Connecting to a single host is always in a 'direct' mode
    otherwise.

  - PERL-546 MongoDB::DBRef objects no longer have a 'fetch' method or
    'client' attribute.  This is consistent with the design of the MongoDB
    drivers for other language.  For the Perl driver, specifically, it
    decouples the BSON model from the MongoClient model, eliminates a
    circular reference, and avoid Perl memory bugs using weak references
    under threads.

  - MongoDB::MongoClient configuration options are now read-only and may
    not be modified after client construction.

  - The $MongoDB::BSON::looks_like_number and $MongoDB::BSON::char global
    variables now ONLY have an effect at MongoDB::MongoClient construction.
    Changing them later does not change BSON encoding.  Both are deprecated
    as well and should not be used in new code.  Instead, the enhanced
    MongoDB::BSON codec class has attributes that encapsulate these
    behaviors.

  - The 'dt_type' MongoDB::MongoClient option has been deprecated and made
    read-only.  It now only takes effect if C<MongoDB::MongoClient>
    constructs a MongoDB::BSON codec object and is read-only so that any
    code that relied on changing it after client construction will fail
    rather that being silently ignored.

  - The 'inflate_dbrefs' MongoDB::MongoClient option has been removed. By
    default, dbrefs are always inflated to MongoDB::DBRef objects.

  - The MongoDB::MongoClient 'read_preference' method is no longer a
    mutator.  It is now only an accessor for a MongoDB::ReadPreference
    object constructed from 'read_preference_mode' and
    'read_preference_tag_sets'.

  - The legacy read preference constants in MongoDB::MongoClient have been
    removed, as they are no longer are used with the new
    MongoDB::ReadPreference class.

  - The MongoDB::MongoClient 'authenticate' method has been removed;
    credentials now must be passed via configuration options and
    authentication is automatic on server connection.

  - The MongoDB::Cursor class has been split. Actual result iteration is
    done via a new MongoDB::QueryResult class.

  - MongoDB::Error exception objects are now used consistently throughout
    the driver, replacing other error mechanism and raw "die" calls.

  - The MongoDB::WriteResult class was renamed to MongoDB::BulkWriteResult.

  - The long-deprecated MongoDB::Connection class has been removed.

  - Low-level client functions have been removed.

  [*** Deprecations ***]

  - PERL-398 The MongoDB::MongoClient 'timeout' and 'query_timeout' options
    are deprecated in favor of new, more explicit 'connect_timeout_ms' and
    'socket_timeout_ms' options.

  - PERL-424 The MongoDB::Cursor 'count' method has been deprecated.

  - PERL-464 The MongoDB::Database 'last_error' method has been deprecated.

  - PERL-507 MongoDB::Collection 'get_collection' method is deprecated; it
    implied sub-collections, which don't actually exist in MongoDB.

  - PERL-511 The old CRUD method names for the MongoDB::Bulk API have been
    deprecated in favor of names that match the new MongoDB::Collection
    CRUD API.

  - PERL-516 The MongoDB::Collection index management methods have been
    deprecated in favor of the new MongoDB::IndexView API.

  - PERL-533 The MongoDB::Collection 'save' method has been deprecated.

  - PERL-534 The MongoDB::Collection 'validate' method has been deprecated.

  - PERL-559 The MongoDB::Database 'eval' method has been deprecated, as
    the MongoDB server version 3.0 deprecated the '$eval' command.

  - The MongoDB::MongoClient 'sasl' and 'sasl_mechanism' config options
    have been deprecated in favor of the more generic 'auth_mechanism'
    option.

  - Legacy MongoDB::Collection CRUD methods (insert, update, etc.) have
    been deprecated in favor of new CRUD API methods.

  - MongoDB::CommandResult changed the name of the accessor for the
    document returned by the server to 'output' instead of 'result' for
    clarity.  The 'result' method is deprecated.

  - As mentioned above, 'dt_type', '$MongoDB::BSON::looks_like_number' and
    '$MongoDB::BSON::char' have been deprecated in addition to their other
    behavior changes.

  [Additions]

  - PERL-93 Implemented awaitData cursor support.

  - PERL-135 Added the ability to set write_concern at database and
    collection level, rather than only in MongoDB::MongoClient.

  - PERL-233 Implemented SSL certificate support via IO::Socket::SSL
    options.

  - PERL-375 Added support for cursor options to the MongoDB::Collection
    'find_one' method.

  - PERL-378 Implemented the cross-driver Server Discovery and Monitoring
    specification.

  - PERL-379 Implemented the cross-driver Server Selection specification.

  - PERL-406 Allowed count methods to work with query hints.

  - PERL-408 Implemented SCRAM-SHA-1 and revised handshake for MongoDB 3.0
    and later.

  - PERL-413 Added max_time_ms as a MongoDB::MongoClient configuration
    option to set a default for database and collection objects.

  - PERL-422 Added support for specifying read preferences in the
    connection string URI.

  - PERL-465 Added support for arbitrary options on index creation.

  - PERL-466 Added the ability to set read preference at the database and
    collection level.

  - PERL-486 Added 'has_modified_count' method to MongoDB::UpdateResult and
    MongoDB::BulkWriteResult to ease detection of when that attribute is
    supported by a server or not.

  - PERL-490 Added 'list_collections' method to MongoDB::Database.

  - PERL-500 Added 'topology_status' method to MongoDB::MongoClient.

  - PERL-502 and PERL-503 Implemented new common driver CRUD API
    specification in MongoDB::Collection.

  - PERL-506 Added support for serializing/deserializing Time::Moment
    objects.

  - PERL-515 Added new MongoDB::IndexView API.

  - PERL-554 Implemented 'server_selection_try_once' configuration option on
    MongoDB::MongoClient.

  - Added an optional read preference argument to 'run_command'.

  - Added 'db' and 'coll' methods as aliases for 'get_database' and
    'get_collection' on MongoDB::MongoClient and MongoDB::Database,
    respectively.

  - Added the 'get_namespace' method to MongoDB::MongoClient (with the
    alias 'ns'), to get a MongoDB::Collection object directly from
    a MongoDB::MongoClient object.

  - Added a 'connect' class method to the MongoDB class for syntactic sugar
    to create a client object.

  - Added a 'with_codec' method to MongoDB::Collection for easier localized
    changes to BSON codec attributes.

  - Added a 'reconnect' method to MongoClient to handle reconnection after
    a fork or thread spawn.

  - Added support for correctly encoding boolean objects from JSON::XS,
    Cpanel::JSON::XS, JSON::PP, JSON::Tiny and Mojo::JSON.

  [Bug Fixes]

  - PERL-146 Normalized server addresses to lower case.

  - PERL-401 Fixed index creation to always have a non-zero write concern.

  - PERL-409 Added missing declarations for MinGW on Windows.

  - PERL-410 Fixed BSON encoding/decoding to detect and throw and error if
    invalid UTF-8 is detected.

  - PERL-429 Fixed read preference tag sets logic.

  - PERL-435 Switched to http-style SSL certificate name validation.

  - PERL-454 Prevented warnings when creating BSON datetimes at the epoch.

  - PERL-477 Fixed list_indexes and list_collections when responses are too
    big to fit in a single database response.

  - PERL-480 Fixed GridFS bug: retrieving a GridFS file now throws an error
    if no chunks exist instead of returning an empty string.

  - PERL-489 Fixed fatal BSON encoding bug serializing references to
    dual-vars.

  - PERL-531 Bulk update/replace documents would not validate properly when
    $MongoDB::BSON::char was not '$'.  While that functionality has moved
    to the MongoDB::BSON codec instead of the global variable, all
    update/replace documents (bulk and CRUD API) are now validated after
    key munging.

  - PERL-536 Fixed GridFS to stop throwing an error when a known empty file
    has no chunks; errors will still be thrown if a non-empty file has no
    chunks.

  - PERL-540 Fixed memory leak in DateTime::Tiny inflation.

  - PERL-543 Fixed a bug serializing undef from Tie::IxHash objects.

  - PERL-556 Fixed serialization of thread-shared variables.

  - Fixed t/cursor.t for new explain format.

  - Removed storage engine dependent code and tests.

  - Fixed MSVC compilation: fix unused vars and statements before
    declarations; removed unused, but problematic bcon.c and bcon.h; use
    Perl memory alloc functions instead of malloc.

  - Made conflicting 'multi' and 'multiple' update options fatal.

  - Fixed use of slave_ok and $readPreference for communicating read
    preferences to a mongos.

  - Fixed t/database.t for change in server error message.

  - Ensured topology type is correct whenever a server is marked
    unavailable.

  - Fixed incorrect 'matched_count' result attribute for upserts.

  - Fixed failing BSON element tests on 32-bit perls.

  - Fixed bug in MongoDB::MongoClient::database_names error handling.

  - Use of -Wall compiler flag during smoke testing has been restricted to
    gcc compilers, only.

  - Fixed encoding to raise an error if an array-reference document
    contains duplicate keys.

  - Stopped encoding scalar-ref objects as BSON BINARY type. (Throws an error
    instead about an unhandled type.)

  - Fixed incorrect configuration test for GCC atomic operations.

  - Fixed bug numifying wtimeout in write concern serialization.

  - Fixed BSON double tests on Perls with long-doubles enabled.

  - Fixed t/gridfs to work around a bug in MongoDB 3.1.2.

  - Fixed a number of XS memory leaks from non-mortalized variables during
    BSON encoding.

  [Changes]

  - PERL-127 Integers that fit in 32-bits are now encoded as BSON Int32;
    larger integers are encoded as BSON Int64; Math::BigInt objects are
    always encoded as BSON Int64.

  - PERL-331 The MongoDB::BSON package is now a full class, implementing a
    BSON encoder-decoder (codec).  It can be supplied as an attribute to
    MongoDB::MongoClient, MongoDB::Database and MongoDB::Collection
    objects.

  - PERL-488 MongoDB::WriteConcern method 'is_safe' renamed to
    'is_acknowledged'.

  - PERL-527 A database name is now optional for MongoDB::DBRef, which is
    consistent with the DBRef specification.

  - PERL-529 Connection string option keys are now parsed
    case-insensitively.

  - PERL-530 The driver now warns on unsupported connection options.

  - PERL-550 DBRefs allow extra fields (for compatibility); this is not
    recommended for new DBRefs.

  - Renamed DocumentSizeError to a more general general DocumentError.

  - MongoDB::Collection attributes that should not be set in the
    constructor have been made private, but with public accessors for
    backwards compatibility.  Private attributes that are set in the
    constructor (e.g. 'database') are now public.

  - Failure to create indexes when constructing a GridFS object are ignored
    rather than a fatal error.

  - Calls to Carp::confess() or die() have been replaced with exceptions
    from MongoDB::Error subclasses, typically MongoDB::UsageError.

  - Generic MongoDB::Error exceptions have been replaced with subclasses
    that have a specific, documented purpose, including:
    MongoDB::AuthError, MongoDB::GridFSError, MongoDB::InternalError and
    MongoDB::UsageError.

  - Configuration options representing times have stricter validation such
    that options that should be non-negative will raise exceptions when
    given negative numbers.

  - BSON code derived from libbson has been updated to libbson 1.1.7.

  - Returns MongoDB::UnacknowledgedResult from unacknowledged writes (i.e.
    { w => 0 } write concern) instead of the corresponding result object
    (i.e. MongoDB::InsertResult for inserts).

  - Loads Authen::SCRAM::Client only on demand, as its Unicode module
    dependencies are costly when not needed.

  - MongoDB::QueryResult attributes have become private, as they are an
    implementation detail and not intended for end-users to inspect.

  - Aborts Makefile.PL on Windows before Vista/2008 for better error
    message than subsequent compilation/test failures.

  - Changes default connect_timeout_ms to 10,000.

  - Credential details omitted from usage error messages.

  [Documentation]

  - PERL-423 Improved documentation of cursor snapshot mode, as it doesn't
    do what many people think it does.

  - PERL-425 Documented deprecation of the 'drop_dups' option for index
    creation.

  - PERL-524 Updated legacy author emails in docs and metadata.

  - Added contributors section to MongoDB main documentation based on git
    commit logs.

  - Added MongoDB::Upgrading document with changes from v0.x.

  - Documented how to disable returning _id from queries.

  - Rearranged Collection and Database documentation.

  - Corrected errors in MongoDB::Cursor documentation.

  [Prerequisites]

  - Added core modules IO::Socket and MIME::Base64 to the dependency list
    for completeness.

  - Added Class::XSAccessor, Moo and Type::Tiny::XS.

  - Enforced minimum versions for configuration requirements.

  - Moved DateTime::Tiny from a test_requires dependency to a
    test_recommends dependency.

  - Removed core modules File::Copy, File::Path and File::Spec from the
    list of test dependencies.

  - Removed Class::MOP::Class as an explicit dependency (still used
    internally by Moose).

  - Removed Data::Types and Data::Dump as test dependencies.

  - Removed File::Slurp.

  - Removed JSON module in favor of JSON::MaybeXS.

  - Removed Moose, Syntax::Keyword::Junction and Throwable.

  - Removed Test::Warn.

  - Updated Path::Tiny minimum version to 0.054 (rather than unspecified).

  - Updated IO::Socket requirement on Windows to 1.31.

  - Updated Authen::SCRAM::Client minimum version to 0.003.

  [Removals]

  - PERL-467 Removed outdated MongoDB::Indexing document.

  - PERL-497 The $MongoDB::BSON::use_boolean never worked; BSON boolean
    values were always deserialized as boolean.pm objects.  Rather than
    "fix" this and break people's code, the option has been removed and
    documented as such.

  - The MongoDB::MongoClient 'auto_connect', 'auto_reconnect', and
    'find_master' methods have been removed, as server discovery and
    selection is now automatic.

  [Testing]

  - PERL-371 Added tests for parsing localhost:port.

  - PERL-492 Implemented server selection tests.

  - PERL-513 Added maxTimeMS tests for CRUD API methods.

  - Changed text index test to use $text operator, not text command (which
    was removed in MongoDB 3.0).

  - Changed t/max_time_ms.t to skip unless $ENV{FAILPOINT_TESTING} is true.

  - Reduced number of threads used in threads testing to avoid out of
    memory errors on memory constrained systems.

  [~ Internal changes ~]

  - PERL-133 Implemented a test that client can connect to replica sets
    without primary.

  - PERL-259 Implemented write commands for MongoDB 2.6+ (i.e. doing writes
    via database commands versus via the wire protocol with OP_INSERT,
    OP_UPDATE, etc.).

  - PERL-325 Updated vendored ppport.h to version 3.31.

  - PERL-433 Updated listCollections to use command form on 3.0 servers.

  - PERL-434 Updated listIndexes to use command form on 3.0 servers.

  - PERL-436 Bumped maxWireProtocolVersion for 3.0 support.

  - PERL-455 Changed to use connect timeout as the socket timeout for
    topology scans.

  - Implemented a 5 second "cooldown" period after a network error during
    topology scanning during which new connection attempts will not be
    made.  This avoids excessive blocking in the driver when it's unlikely
    that the server will be available right away.

  - Removed unused vendored libyajl files.

  - Refactored and reorganized perl-mongo.h and perl_mongo.c.  Removed
    unused functions and macros.

  - Disabled many internal class type constraints and runtime assertions
    unless the PERL_MONGO_WITH_ASSERTS environment variable is true.

  - Changed use of 'strerror_s' to 'strerror' to attempt to get C/XS
    linking on Windows XP.

  - Changed all Moose classes to Moo classes for speed and to minimize the
    deep dependency tree.

  - Changed argument handling for CRUD API methods to stop coercing inputs
    to Tie::IxHash.  This makes them significantly faster.

  - Optimized networking code paths substantially.

  - Consolidated various constants to MongoDB::_Constants.

  - Inlined and adapted the Throwable CPAN module to avoid deep
    dependencies for MongoDB::Error.

    the Data Types documentation on using the Binary type instead of string refs
    for binary data.

  - Change default binary type from 2 to 0.  See MongoDB::BSON::Binary for
    more information about the implications of this change.

  [Bug Fixes]

  - Fix auth connection issues (Olly Stephens)

  - Fix driver creating duplicate connections when port isn't specified (Olly
    Stephens)

  - Fix authentication check on some versions of Perl (Olly Stephens)

0.45 - September 7, 2011

  This is a recommended upgrade.  There are no backwards-breaking changes, only
  bug fixes and enhancements.

  [Enhancements]

  - Perl 5.8.4 and higher is now officially supported (5.8.7 was the previous
    minimum version).

  - Improved the way that connecting handles an interrupt signal.  The driver
    now continues to attempt connection for the remaining duration of the
    timeout, instead of erroring out immediately.

  [Bug Fixes]

  - Fixed MaxKey and MinKey deserialization. Deserializing these types would seg
    fault if they hadn't been serialized previously.

  - Fixed Windows compilation (Taro Nishino)

  - Fixed MakeMaker arguments which were causing build problems on 5.14.

0.44 - July 26, 2011

  This is a recommended upgrade.  There are no backwards-breaking changes, only
  bug-fixes and enhancements.

  [Enhancements]

  - Added MongoDB::BSON::looks_like_number flag.

    The Perl driver has always been coy about turning strings into numbers.  If
    you would like aggressive number parsing (if it looks like a number, send it
    to the DB as a number), you can set MongoDB::BSON::looks_like_number to 1
    (defaults to 0, the previous behavior).  See the MongoDB::DataTypes pod for
    more info.

  - Tests should now clean up after themselves, leaving no test databases
    behind.

  [Bug Fixes]

  - Setting a sort in the arguments to MongoDB::Collection::find is now passed
    through correctly to the cursor.

  - Fixed segmentation fault in array serialization: caused by specifying an _id
    field on insert and using an array (not a hash or Tie::IxHash).

  - Fixed segmentation fault in threading: if Mouse was used instead of Moose,
    version 0.43 of the driver would segfault if multiple threads were used.

  - MongoDB::Cursor now inherits the $Mongo::Cursor::slave_okay global setting,
    as well as checking if slave_okay is set on the cursor instance.

  - Fix GridFS functions to only ensure GridFS indexes on writes, allowing
    GridFS API usage on slaves.

0.43 - May 31, 2011

  This is a recommended upgrade.  There are no backwards-breaking changes, only
  bug-fixes and enhancements.

  [Enhancements]

  - Auto-detects max BSON size for inserts, which means documents larger than
    4MB can now be inserted.  See L<MongoDB::Connection/max_bson_size> for
    details.

  - Added the L<MongoDB::Cursor/info> method, which returns meta information
    about the results being returned.

  [Bug Fixes]

  - When high UTF-8 values as hash keys, the driver now croaks instead of
    segfaulting.

  - Added 'use IO::File' before IO::File is used (Michael Langner)

  - Fixed Perl 5.14 compile (Chip Salzenberg)

  - Added TO_JSON function to MongoDB::OID
  - Fixed safe save (Othello Maurer)
  - BACKWARD-BREAKING: removed old indexing syntax (if you started using the
    driver less than a year ago, this shouldn't affect you.  If you're an old-
    timer, make sure you're not using the syntax that has been deprecated for a
    year).

0.33 26 April 2010
