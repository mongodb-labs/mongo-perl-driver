0.46

  [Enhancements]

  - Added SSL support (Casey Rojas). See new documentation on
    MongoDB::Connection's ssl attribute.

  - Added MongoDB::BSON::Binary type and MongoDB::BSON::use_binary option. See
    the Data Types documentation on using the Binary type instead of string refs
    for binary data.

  - Change default binary type from 2 to 0.  See MongoDB::BSON::Binary for
    more information about the implications of this change.

  [Bug Fixes]

  - Fix auth connection issues (Olly Stephens)

  - Fix driver creating duplicate connections when port isn't specified (Olly
    Stephens)

  - Fix authentication check on some versions of Perl (Olly Stephens)

0.45 - September 7, 2011

  This is a recommended upgrade.  There are no backwards-breaking changes, only
  bug fixes and enhancements.

  [Enhancements]

  - Perl 5.8.4 and higher is now officially supported (5.8.7 was the previous
    minimum version).

  - Improved the way that connecting handles an interrupt signal.  The driver
    now continues to attempt connection for the remaining duration of the
    timeout, instead of erroring out immediately.

  [Bug Fixes]

  - Fixed MaxKey and MinKey deserialization. Deserializing these types would seg
    fault if they hadn't been serialized previously.

  - Fixed Windows compilation (Taro Nishino)

  - Fixed MakeMaker arguments which were causing build problems on 5.14.

0.44 - July 26, 2011

  This is a recommended upgrade.  There are no backwards-breaking changes, only
  bug-fixes and enhancements.

  [Enhancements]

  - Added MongoDB::BSON::looks_like_number flag.

    The Perl driver has always been coy about turning strings into numbers.  If
    you would like aggressive number parsing (if it looks like a number, send it
    to the DB as a number), you can set MongoDB::BSON::looks_like_number to 1
    (defaults to 0, the previous behavior).  See the MongoDB::DataTypes pod for
    more info.

  - Tests should now clean up after themselves, leaving no test databases
    behind.

  [Bug Fixes]

  - Setting a sort in the arguments to MongoDB::Collection::find is now passed
    through correctly to the cursor.

  - Fixed segmentation fault in array serialization: caused by specifying an _id
    field on insert and using an array (not a hash or Tie::IxHash).

  - Fixed segmentation fault in threading: if Mouse was used instead of Moose,
    version 0.43 of the driver would segfault if multiple threads were used.

  - MongoDB::Cursor now inherits the $Mongo::Cursor::slave_okay global setting,
    as well as checking if slave_okay is set on the cursor instance.

  - Fix GridFS functions to only ensure GridFS indexes on writes, allowing
    GridFS API usage on slaves.

0.43 - May 31, 2011

  This is a recommended upgrade.  There are no backwards-breaking changes, only
  bug-fixes and enhancements.

  [Enhancements]

  - Auto-detects max BSON size for inserts, which means documents larger than
    4MB can now be inserted.  See L<MongoDB::Connection/max_bson_size> for
    details.

  - Added the L<MongoDB::Cursor/info> method, which returns meta information
    about the results being returned.

  [Bug Fixes]

  - When high UTF-8 values as hash keys, the driver now croaks instead of
    segfaulting.

  - Added 'use IO::File' before IO::File is used (Michael Langner)

  - Fixed Perl 5.14 compile (Chip Salzenberg)

    done over a given connection

  - added TO_JSON function to MongoDB::OID

  - BACKWARD-BREAKING: removed old indexing syntax (if you started using the
    driver less than a year ago, this shouldn't affect you.  If you're an old-
    timer, make sure you're not using the syntax that has been deprecated for a
    year).
